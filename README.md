Inspire
===

Half of any web project is the design. It's what makes the user want to keep coming back. Here's a list of sites I have found that help inspire my designs, then build them.

## Concept 
<h5>These site to get a general idea of possible layouts and style paths to take.</h5>
* [TheBestDesigns](http://www.thebestdesigns.com/) - General list of hand picked sites from across the web.
* [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) - Snaps of icons, doodles, sites, and more from a talented group of people.
* [MinimalSites](http://www.minimalsites.com/) - Another list of sites, but on the much simpler side.

## Creation
<h5>These sites are good for building a basic framework for the site.</h5>
* [ColorPicker](http://www.colorpicker.com/) - Simple yet affective. The name says it all.
